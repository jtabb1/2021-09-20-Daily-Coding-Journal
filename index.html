    <p> 
      Yesterday, my final commit on my project for the night 
      met the full rubric points for the project in my 
      estimation.

      Today I attended a Flatiron School lecture, helped my 
      Mom, worked on my small rental business, and I plan 
      to finish doing that tonight then I will add styling 
      to my project, which was unnecessary from the rubric's 
      point of view, but makes it look nicer to people.
